#Task 1: Keyword Highlighter

#Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as 
# "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". 
# We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review with the keywords in uppercase.

#reviews = [
    #     "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
    #     "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
    #     "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
    #     "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
    #     "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
    # ]

#So for the first string in the reviews list, we want it to say: 
# "This product is really GOOD. I'm impressed with its quality."

reviews = [
        "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
        "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
        "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
        "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",
        "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it."
    ]

keywords = ["good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", "average"]

review = reviews.split(",")
print(review)

     











#Task 2: Sentiment Tally

#Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review.  
# The function should return the total count of positive and negative words.
    # positive_words = ["good", "excellent", "great", "awesome", "fantastic", "superb", "amazing"]
    # negative_words = ["bad", "poor", "terrible", "horrible", "awful", "disappointing", "subpar"]




#Task 3: Review Summary

# Implement a script that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "â€¦" to create a summary. 
# Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.

# Example: "This product is really good. I'm...",
